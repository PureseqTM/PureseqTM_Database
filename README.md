# Dataset for PureseqTM
The datasets for training and testing PureseqTM can be found here. In addition, the Human proteome data is provided. For each dataset, we also generated the prediction results from [Phobius](http://phobius.sbc.su.se/), [Philius](http://www.yeastrc.org/philius/pages/philius/runPhilius.jsp), [Topcons2](http://topcons.cbr.su.se/), and [PureseqTM](http://pureseqtm.predmp.com/).
